Abeille is able to perform simulations using both multi-group and continuous
energy physics. We first outline the use of multi-group cross sections, as this
does not require the installation of processing of any extra data.

Multi-Group Nuclear Data

It is advantageous to be able to perform simulations using multi-group physics
for a variety of reasons. These include testing Abeille against analytic
solutions for simple benchmark problems, and also for comparing against and
validating deterministic solvers.
